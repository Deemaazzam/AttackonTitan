                Eren is manipulating events from the future: This theory
                suggests that Eren is using his power as the Attack Titan to
                manipulate events in the present in order to change the
                outcome of the future.

                Mikasa is an Ackerman hybrid: This theory proposes that Mikasa
                is a hybrid of the Ackerman and Asian bloodlines, which gives
                her enhanced abilities and immunity to the Founding
                Titan's mind control.

                Armin is the true hero of the story: This theory suggests that
                Armin, rather than Eren, is the true hero of the story, and that
                he will ultimately be the one to save humanity.
              </p>
            </li>

              <p>
                the final chapter will have a time loop: This theory proposes
                that the final chapter of the series will feature a time loop,
                in which the characters are trapped in a cycle of events that
                they are unable to break.
              </p>

                the series is a commentary on war and nationalism: This theory
                suggests that the series is a commentary on the dangers of war
                and nationalism, and that it is meant to be a cautionary tale

                Titans subconsciously know eating a Titan shifter
                will revert them back to human form.They eat every
                person in the hopes they'll turn back, even though they don't
                seem to have any real drive or motivation.
