      <h3>The Military of Paradise Island</h3>
      <p>
        The Military, also known as the Armed Forces of Eldia, are the main
        militia of the inhabitants of Paradis Island, who were originally
        trained for the purpose of defending said territory from the Titans. It
        is a full-time, professional, and trained army to face the Titans. The
        army is divided into three squads: The Survey Corps; the Garrison; and
        the Military Police Brigade. We shall now explain each of these units In
        the Attack on Titan universe, there are several military units that play
        important roles in defending humanity against the Titans. Here's a brief
        explanation of each unit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Scout Regiment:</h4>
          <p>
            Also known as the Survey Corps, this is the most prestigious and
            dangerous unit in the military. They are responsible for exploring
            the outside world and gathering information about the Titans, and
            are often sent on expeditions beyond the walls. Members of the Scout
            Regiment are highly skilled in combat and vertical maneuvering,
            using their 3D maneuver gear to navigate the terrain
            and engage Titans.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Garrison Regiment:</h4>
          <p>
            This unit is responsible for maintaining order and defending the
            walls of the three innermost districts. They are made up of soldiers
            who are less skilled in combat than those in the Scout Regiment, but
            are still highly trained and well-equipped. The Garrison Regiment
            also provides support to other units during Titan attacks.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Military Police Bridage:</h4>
          <p>
            This unit is responsible for maintaining law and order within the
            innermost district, which is the safest area within the walls. They
            are made up of soldiers who are considered to be the best of the
            best, and have a reputation for being corrupt and elitist. Members
            of the Military Police Brigade are rarely involved in combat, but
            instead focus on maintaining their privileged
            position within society.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Training Corps:</h4>
          <p>
            This unit is responsible for training new recruits and preparing
            them for the challenges of the military. It is considered to be the
            lowest rank in the military, and recruits are often subjected to
            harsh training and discipline. Once they graduate from the Training
            Corps, soldiers are assigned to one of the other units based on
            their skills and abilities.
