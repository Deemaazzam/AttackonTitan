      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        The story is set in a world where humanity is forced to live within
        three massive walls, known as Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina,<img
          src="walls.jpeg"
          style="float: right; width: 300px"
          title="The three walls"
        />
        which protect them from Titans, giant humanoid creatures who devour
        humans for seemingly no reason. The Titans come in a variety of sizes
        and shapes, but all have one thing in common: their insatiable hunger
        for human flesh. The main protagonist of the story is Eren Yeager , a
        young boy who lives with his parents in the outermost district of Wall
        Maria. One day, a colossal Titan appears and destroys the gate of Wall
        Maria,<img src="walls1.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 300px" />
        allowing a horde of smaller Titans to enter and wreak havoc on the city.
        Eren's mother is killed in the attack, and he swears to get revenge by
        killing all the Titans. Several years later, Eren, along with his
        adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and best friend Armin Arlert, join the
        military as part of the Survey Corps, a branch of the military tasked
        with exploring outside the walls and gathering information about the
        Titans. Eren discovers that he has the ability to transform into a
        Titan, a rare power that is not well understood. This ability puts him
        in danger, as some members of the military view him as a threat. As the
        story progresses, Eren and his friends uncover the truth about the
        Titans and the world they live in. They learn that the Titans were
        created by a mysterious race of people called the Founding Titans, who
        have the ability to control them. The Founding Titans are also
        responsible for creating the walls that protect humanity. The Survey
        Corps eventually discovers that the ruling government has been keeping
        secrets about the true nature of the Titans and the history of humanity.
        Eren's father had injected him with a serum that would allow him to
        access the Founding Titan's power and memories. Eren uses this power to
        learn about the past and uncover the government's secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the story progresses, Eren and his friends face numerous battles
        against the Titans, some of which result in the deaths of beloved
        characters. They encounter various factions within the military and
        government who have their own agendas and motives, leading to
        complicated political and moral dilemmas. The story also explores themes
        of power, corruption, and the lengths people will go to in order to
        protect their own interests. The characters struggle to navigate their
        own morals and beliefs as they fight against both Titans and their
        fellow humans. Throughout the series, the stakes become higher and the
        battle between humanity and the Titans intensifies. The Titans are not
        mindless monsters, and some even display intelligence and human-like
        behavior. The characters also encounter new types of Titans, such as the
        Beast Titan and the Female Titan, who possess unique abilities and
        characteristics. The series has been adapted into multiple anime
        seasons, with a fourth and final season currentlyÂ airing.

      <h3>To You,In 2000 Years</h3>
      <p>
        Legend has it that in the year -1003, The story of the Titans begins
        with the first Titan,a young girl named Ymir,once lived a provincial
        life in a small village. Everything changed when a warrior tribe called
        the Eldians attacked.The villagers were either killed or enslaved.One
        day, Ymir let her masters' pigs escape. The Eldian King Fritz set her
        "free" but commanded his warriors to hunt her. The injured Ymir took
        refuge in an enormous tree,where a creature, resembling a cross between
        a centipede and disembodied nervous system, bonded with her,turning her
        into the first Titan.
        <img
          src="ymir.jpg"
          style="float: right; width: 200px"
          title="Ymir's contact with the creature"
        />
        With this power/curse, Ymir was able to overthrow all of her enemies,
        who at that time were grouped in the well-known Marley Empire.13 years
        after Ymir became a titan,she was killed saving Fritz from assassination
        by Marleyans
        <img src="ymir2.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 250px" /> .To preserve
        her power,Fritz fed her remains to their daughters. Filtered through
        generations,nine distint titans emerged. Ymir's own power became called
        the Founding Titan and was passed down through her and Fritz's direct
        descendants;only those of royal blood can wield its powers. The Titans
        left their people in an era of prosperity thanks to the use of this
        magical power. From the year -989 to 710 was a dark time for humanity.
        The great power granted by the Nine Titans made their wielders believe
        they had the right to dominate different parts of the world, steal their
        possessions, and even choose some humans to mate with. Thus was born the
        Ackerman family (to which both Levi and Mikasa would belong many years
        later). From the beginning, they were brainwashed to protect the bearer
        of the Founder Titan, something we will see in the aforementioned
        protagonist's behavior towards Eren from the beginning of the anime. The
        Ackerman, who were characterized by their incredible fighting skills,
        were eventually joined by the Asians of the Hizuru clan (led by the
        Azumabito family), who had a lot of dealings with the royal family that
        passed the Founder Titan from generation to generation.
      </p>
      <h3>Fall of the Eldians</h3>
      <p>
        Karl fritz, the 145th Eldian King,was aghast by his people's legacy of
        violence. To repent,he decides to orchestrtate his own empire's fall.The
        king conspires in secret with the Tybur family,holders of the WarHammer
        Titan.Fritz and the Tybur fabricated a story about a Marleyan named
        "Helos" slaying "The Devil of all Earth".Fritz then took the royal
        family and many other Eldians to the island Paradise.Using the Founder's
        power, he creates millions of Colossal Titans who together formed the
        walls. To amke sure no Eldians venture outside the walls,Fritz erases
        his people's collective memory,making them believe they're the last of
        humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the royal family goes underground, placing a puppet king on
        the throne while they rule in secret as the "Reiss" family. For the next
        century, the Founding Titan and the memories of its holders are passed
        down through the Reiss family. Its holders thus inherit not just Karl
        Fritz's power, but also his pacifist ideology, ensuring that none of
        them ever set lose the Wall Titans to rebuild the Empire.
      </p>
      <h3>Outside The walls</h3>
      <p>
        While the world stayed static within Paradis' walls, it didn't outside.
        With Marley now in possession of seven out of the nine Titans, they
        become the world's new superpower. Helos and the Devil of All Earth go
        from myth to history, while the Eldians left outside Paradis are pushed
        into internment zones, forced to wear identifying armbands, and treated
        as second-class citizens at best and vermin at worst.The Marleyans keep
        the Eldians around for use in their Warrior program; Eldian children who
        inherit Titan powers and serve in Marley's military earn citizenship for
        themselves and their families (the War Hammer remains in the Tyburs'
        control). Defiant Eldians are punished by being sent to Paradis Island
        and transformed into the Pure Titans menacing their cousins inside the
        wall; in 785, Eldians called "the Cult of Ymir," including a young girl
        named after the Founder, suffer this fate.

        title="Grisha & his sister"
      />
      <p>
        In 806, Eldian Grisha Yeager is born in the Liberio internment zone. In
        817, his younger sister Fay (born 809) is killed by Marleyans guards,
        pushing Grisha to join the "Eldian Restorationist" movement in 824.
        Grisha marries Dina Fritz, the last royal Eldian outside the walls, and
        has a son with her, Zeke, in 825. The Yeagers push Zeke to become a
        warrior, but at the advice of his mentor Tom Ksaver, Zeke sells his
        parents out in 832.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Restorationists bar Grisha are made into Titans on Paradis.
        Grisha is saved by Marleyan officer Kruger, a secret Eldian and holder
        of the Attack Titan. Kruger passes the Attack Titan to Grisha and sends
        him to the Walls to claim the Founding Titan from the Reiss family.
        Between 832 and 835, Grisha marries Carla Yeager and becomes the doctor
        in Shiganshina, an outlying district of Wall Maria.
      </p>
      <h3>New Warriors</h3>
      <p>
        Back in Marley, the government begins to plot the invasion of Paradis,
        both to claim the Founding Titan and the island's resources. Zeke
        inherits the Beast Titan from Ksaver in 842, and leads the next
        generation of Warriors, selected the following year:<img

        Annie Leonhart the Female Titan (born 834), Reiner Braun the Armored
        Titan (born 833), Bertholdt Hoover,the Colossal Titan, Pieck Finger the
        Cart Titan, and Marcel Galliard the Jaw Titan. In 845, Reiner, Annie,
        Bertholdt, and Marcel are sent to Paradis to begin the invasion. Before
        they reach the walls, the pure Titan that was once Ymir attacks them and
        eats Marcel. Ymir inherits the power of the Jaw Titan and regains her
        human form, but the Warriors run away before they can witness this.
        Annie and Bertholdt consider abandoning the mission but Reiner implores
        them to push forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transforming into The colossal Titan,Bertholdt breaks down the wall of Shiganshina.
        and there's when the plot of "Attack on Titan" begins.
