            <p>
              Hajime Isayama is a Japanese manga artist, best known as the
              creator of the manga series "Attack on Titan" (Shingeki no
              Kyojin). He was born on August 29, 1986, in Hita, Oita
              Prefecture, Japan. Isayama began drawing manga in his early teens,
              and after graduating from high school, he enrolled in a manga
              design program at a vocational school in Fukuoka. He initially
              struggled to find success as a manga artist, but he eventually
              gained recognition for his short manga series "Heart Break One,"
              which was published in the Bessatsu Shonen Magazine in 2006. In
              2009, Isayama began working on "Attack on Titan," a
              post-apocalyptic manga series set in a world where humanity lives
              in cities surrounded by massive walls to protect themselves from
              giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. The series has become
              incredibly popular both in Japan and internationally, with
              millions of copies sold worldwide and numerous adaptations in
              various media, including anime, video games, and live-action
              films. Isayama has received several awards and nominations for his
              work on "Attack on Titan," including the Kodansha Manga Award for
              best shonen manga in 2011 and the Harvey Award for best manga in
              2014. He is known for his dark and mature storytelling, as well as
              his detailed and dynamic artwork.
