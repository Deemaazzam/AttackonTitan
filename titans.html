      <h3>Titans</h3>
      <p>
        In the Attack on Titan universe, there are several types and
        classifications of Titans. Here's a brief explanation of each type:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Pure Titans:</h4>
          <p>
            These are Titans that were once human, but were transformed into
            Titans through unknown means. They have no intelligence and simply
            wander around, eating humans without any apparent reason. Pure
            Titans come in a variety of sizes, ranging from the small, 3-4 meter
            Titans to the colossal Titans that are over 60 meters tall.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Abnormal Titans:</h4>
          <p>
            These are Titans that behave differently from typical Pure Titans.
            They are more aggressive and unpredictable, and often exhibit
            abnormal behavior such as running on all fours or exhibiting unusual
            movements. Abnormal Titans are a major threat to human safety
            because they are difficult to predict and can quickly change
            direction or attack unexpectedly.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Colossal Titans:</h4>
          <p>
            These are Titans that are over 60 meters tall and possess incredible
            strength and destructive power. They are rare and are usually only
            seen during major battles or when breaching the walls. Colossal
            Titans are particularly dangerous because of their immense size and
            the amount of damage they can inflict.
